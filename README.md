# Loan Repayment Prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook represents a machine learning exploration for predicting loan repayment difficulties. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of several machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. The final model selection is based on various performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various financial and personal attributes including total income, credit amount, and the number of children, etc. The target variable indicates whether a client has had difficulties repaying a loan (`0` for no difficulties, `1` for difficulties).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.5
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, xgboost

## Usage

-> Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook directory.

-> Open the Jupyter notebook.

-> Install the required libraries.

-> Execute the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and model training.

## Models and Evaluation

The notebook includes a comparison of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Tuning of model hyperparameters is performed where necessary to improve the predictions.
